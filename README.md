# Surf Forecaster

This was a self-directed project done through a busy semester. The goal was to create a web app that would allow users to click on an interactive satellite map of the earth and have the app return general information about the waves in that area, averaged from the nearest 3 available buoy's data. I wanted to create a tool that could help surfers find waves in more remote areas through combining the use of satellite images to see natural features with general information on waves.

I had the map sorted out through Google Maps' API, and the general layout completed through JS/HTML/CSS. When it came time to start calling the NOAA's buoy's for data, I kept getting errors.

Turns out:

And when I tried to use another surf forecasting company's data:

I ended up just randomizing the wave information so I could have a mostly finished product.

To test it out, click the map and drop a pin, then click on that pin. There is a small bug that when you search via the search bar and drop a pin, that first pin is unclickable, so just drop another one.
